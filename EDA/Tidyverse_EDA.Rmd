# Introduction

knitr::include_graphics("./images/tidyverse.PNG")
```

# Data

Data provided by Kaggle.  16k+ survey.

Will start with `read.csv` to serve as an example.

```{r}
# https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017#multipleChoiceResponses.csv
multipleChoiceResponses_base <- read.csv("./data/multipleChoiceResponses.csv")
```

# Explore the Data

## NAs

Below `~` is the formula and the dot `.` menas all columns
```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses_base %>% purrr::map_df(~ sum(is.na(.)))
```

Always be cautious whn you see variables with 0 NAs - data isnever clean.  Investigate using `count` - a shortcut for a `group_by` and `summarize`

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses_base %>% count(StudentStatus)
```

OK, now we know there are empty string - something `is.na` does not recognize!

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses_base %>% na_if("")
```


View the import problems to understand how the errors arose.
```{r}
problems(multipleChoiceResponses_base)
```

Modify the data using the reassignment pipe `%<>%` - simple a short cut.  Requires `magrittr` - why this was not loaded with `tidyverse` I do not know.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
multipleChoiceResponses_base %<>% na_if("")
# multipleChoiceResponses_base <- multipleChoiceResponses_base %>% na.if("")
```

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses_base %>% purrr::map_df(~ sum(is.na(.)))
```

Afer transforming empty strings to `NA`, the output is more insightfull.

This all could have been avoided by using `read_csv`.  Much faster.

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses <- read_csv("./data/multipleChoiceResponses.csv")
```

Look at the problems:

```{r}
problems(multipleChoiceResponses)
```
`'read_csv` assumes the filed type using the first 1k of values.  Change this

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses <- read_csv("./data/multipleChoiceResponses.csv", 
                                    guess_max = nrow(multipleChoiceResponses))
```

No problems reported!

# Examine the data

```{r}
length(names(multipleChoiceResponses))
```

Lots of columns.View with `skimr` - particularly helpful with numerical columns

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% skimr::skim()
```

> Note the age range - unlikely someone was 100 taking the survey.  We have data issues.

Helpful to know how many disticnt values for each column

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% purrr::map_df(~ n_distinct(.))
```

Hard to read.  Change it:

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% purrr::map_df(~ n_distinct(.)) %>%  
  tidyr::gather(Question, num_distinct_answers)
```

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% purrr::map_df(~ n_distinct(.)) %>%  
  tidyr::gather(Question, num_distinct_answers) %>% arrange(desc(num_distinct_answers))
```
Sure looks like there may be too many distinct values.

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% count(WorkMethodsSelect, sort=TRUE)
```

Note there are methods separated by a comma.  There must haven been a mutiple selection method.  Want to separate them out.

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% select(WorkMethodsSelect) %>% filter(!is.na(WorkMethodsSelect)) %>% 
  mutate(work_method = str_split(WorkMethodsSelect, ","))
```

The new column is a list of the number of commas found in each record.  Not very helpful.

```{r}
unnested_workMethods <- multipleChoiceResponses %>% select(WorkMethodsSelect) %>% filter(!is.na(WorkMethodsSelect)) %>% 
  mutate(work_method = str_split(WorkMethodsSelect, ",")) %>% 
  unnest(work_method) %>% 
  select(work_method)
unnested_workMethods
```

There are now 59k+ rows compared to 7k (after NAs were removed).

There is another way to do this using `separate_rows`:

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% select(WorkMethodsSelect) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(WorkMethodsSelect)) %>% separate_rows(WorkMethodsSelect, sep = ",")
```

> The parameter `sep=` is required to be written in the expression.

# Questions

What kind if questions might be asked?

```{r}
method_freq <- unnested_workMethods %>% count(work_method, sort = TRUE)
method_freq
```

```{r}
unnested_workMethods %>% count(work_method) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = work_method, y = n)) +
  geom_col() + coord_flip()
```

`fct_reorder` can improve the visualization.

```{r}
unnested_workMethods %>% count(work_method) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(work_method, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() + coord_flip()
```

There are many features named similarly.

```{r}
multipleChoiceResponses %>% select(contains("WorkChallengeFrequency"))
```

There are 22 features similarly named. `stringr::str_remove`

```{r}
WorkChallenges <- multipleChoiceResponses %>% select(contains("WorkChallengeFrequency")) %>% 
  gather(Question, Response) %>%  filter(!is.na(Response)) %>% 
  mutate(Question = stringr::str_remove(Question, "WorkChallengeFrequency"))
WorkChallenges
```

```{r}
WorkChallenges %>% count(Response)
```

```{r}
WorkChallenges %>% 
  mutate(Response = if_else(Response %in% c("Most of the time", "Often"), 1, 0))
```

```{r}
perc_problem_work_challenge <- WorkChallenges %>% 
  mutate(Response = if_else(Response %in% c("Most of the time", "Often"), 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(Question) %>% summarise(perc_problem = mean(Response))
perc_problem_work_challenge
```

```{r}
ggplot(perc_problem_work_challenge, aes(x = fct_reorder(Question, perc_problem), y = perc_problem)) + 
  geom_point() + coord_flip() + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(x = "Question", y = "Percent Encountering Challenge Frequently")
```
